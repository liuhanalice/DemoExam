                    <p class="card-text">You are going to take an online demo exam with questions selected from standardized tests like SAT, GRE and etc. There will be <strong>3 sections</strong> with different question types. Each section contains <strong>3 to 5 questions </strong>and you will have <strong>10 minutes</strong> for each section. You may submit your answers and go to the next section before the section time ends. You may go to previous questions during the section but you will not be able to go back to questions from previous sections. Don't worry, the exam is anonymous and your answers will not be recorded for correctness. However, please pretend it is a real exam. Your activities on the demo exam will not be shared with groups or people outside our study group and your data will only be collected for our study purpose.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">During the demo exam, you are able to change the user interface anytime. Before each section starts, you will have the chance to customize your interface for the section's question type specifically and your changes will be applied to the whole section. But you may also change your interface setting at any time after the section starts. Your interface preference and your activities of customizing the interface will be recorded only for our study purpose. Please copy your activity log displayed to you after you submit the exam. More information and instructions will show to you later.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Thank you so much for your participation!</p>
